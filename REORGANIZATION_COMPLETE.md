   - **Reason**: Backup of monolithic file during modularization
   - **Modern Replacement**: `core/react-pattern-adapters.js` (clean modular imports)

2. **`organisms/tmyl-search-interface-monolith-backup.js`** (828 lines)
   - **Status**: ✅ Archived to `_archived/refactoring-backups/`
   - **Reason**: Backup of monolithic file during modularization  
   - **Modern Replacement**: `organisms/tmyl-search-interface.js` (modular component)

#### **✅ COMPLETED: Temporary Files Removed**
3. **`core/react-pattern-adapters-new.js`** (~30 lines)
   - **Status**: ✅ Deleted (temporary file)
   - **Reason**: Intermediate file created during refactoring process

### **Legacy Components Status**

#### **🟡 PRESERVED: Legacy Components (Backward Compatibility)**
4-8. **All `legacy/*.js` files**
   - **Status**: 🟡 **PRESERVED** with deprecation warnings
   - **Reason**: Still exported for backward compatibility
   - **Action Taken**: Created `legacy/index.js` with deprecation warnings
   - **Modern Replacements**: Available in `core/adapters/`
   - **Migration Path**: Clear guidance provided for modern alternatives

#### **🟡 PRESERVED: Legacy CSS Files**
9-13. **All `legacy/*.css` files**
   - **Status**: 🟡 **PRESERVED** (still referenced by legacy components)
   - **Reason**: Required by legacy JavaScript components
   - **Future Action**: Can be archived when legacy components are retired

### **Already Properly Organized**

#### **✅ GOOD: Application Backups**
14-15. **`applications/_legacy-backup/*`**
   - **Status**: ✅ **PROPERLY ORGANIZED** 
   - **Reason**: Good backup practice from previous cleanup
   - **Action**: No action needed - exemplary archive organization
