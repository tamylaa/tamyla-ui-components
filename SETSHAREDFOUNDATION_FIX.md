# setSharedFoundation Runtime Error Fix

## Problem Description

The UI components were throwing a runtime error:
```
TypeError: factory.setSharedFoundation is not a function
    at AtomFactory.setupSharedFoundation
```

This error occurred because the `AtomFactory` was trying to call `setSharedFoundation()` on all factory instances (`ButtonFactory`, `InputFactory`, and `CardFactory`), but only the `InputFactory` had this method implemented.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `AtomFactory.setupSharedFoundation()` method:

```javascript
setupSharedFoundation() {
  [this.button, this.input, this.card].forEach(factory => {
    factory.setSharedFoundation(this.tokens, this.utilities); // ❌ ButtonFactory and CardFactory didn't have this method
  });
}
```

## Solution

Added the missing `setSharedFoundation` method to both `ButtonFactory` and `CardFactory`:

### ButtonFactory Fix (in `atoms/button/button-system.js`)
```javascript
/**
 * Set shared foundation from main factory
 */
setSharedFoundation(tokens, utilities) {
  this.tokens = tokens;
  this.utilities = utilities;
}
```

### CardFactory Fix (in `atoms/card/card-system.js`)
```javascript
/**
 * Set shared foundation from main factory
 */
setSharedFoundation(tokens, utilities) {
  this.tokens = tokens;
  this.utilities = utilities;
}
```

## Verification

The fix has been verified through:

1. ✅ **Static Analysis**: All three factories now have the `setSharedFoundation` method in the built files
2. ✅ **Method Count**: Found 4 `setSharedFoundation` methods in the built file (3 implementations + 1 call)
3. ✅ **Interface Consistency**: All factories now implement the expected interface
4. ✅ **Build Success**: The package builds without errors and includes the fix

## Version Update

- **Previous Version**: 1.1.0
- **Fixed Version**: 1.1.1 (patch release for bug fix)

## Usage

After updating to version 1.1.1, the following code that was previously failing should now work:

```javascript
import { atomFactory, createButton, createInput, createCard } from '@tamyla/ui-components';

// This will no longer throw "setSharedFoundation is not a function"
const button = createButton({ variant: 'primary', text: 'Click me' });
const input = createInput({ type: 'email', label: 'Email' });
const card = createCard({ variant: 'elevated', content: 'Hello world' });
```

## Files Modified

1. `packages/ui-components/atoms/button/button-system.js` - Added `setSharedFoundation` method
2. `packages/ui-components/atoms/card/card-system.js` - Added `setSharedFoundation` method
3. `packages/ui-components/package.json` - Version bump to 1.1.1
4. Built files regenerated with the fix

## Testing

You can verify the fix using the provided test files:
- `test-fix.html` - Browser-based testing (requires serving locally)
- `test-static.mjs` - Node.js static analysis verification

To run the static test:
```bash
cd packages/ui-components
node test-static.mjs
```

## Impact

This fix resolves the critical runtime error that was preventing the UI components from initializing properly. All three factory types (`ButtonFactory`, `InputFactory`, `CardFactory`) now have consistent interfaces and can receive shared design tokens and utilities from the main `AtomFactory`.
